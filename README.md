![main page of app](./docs/screenshots_of_app/main_page.png)
Simple app that makes and displays the todo-list. And then display the feedback of the to-do list after taking the level of achievement from users.
You can also view your previous lists, and delete the lists if you require.  
  
  
## **Features in this application**  

1. ### **Displays the user's any date along with the title**  
   Dates can be entered in any style you like.  
   For example: `4/24`, `4th April`, `4月24日`, etc.  
   
   The date obtained from the user will be displayed as follows.  
   ```
   ----------------
   TODO DATE: 4/24 
   ----------------
   ```  

1. ### **Create tasks from the terminal command line and display them**  
   It gets the user's task from the terminal command line and displays the task line by line with the task number.  
   For example, when you run 
   ```
   $ ruby main.rb "Go to school" "Finish assignment" "Clean my room"
   ```
   The todo list tasks will be displayed as follows.  

   ```
   1: Go to school  
   2: Finish assignment  
   3: Clean my room
   ```
   If no tasks in the command line, the program will exit.  
   ```
   $ ruby main.rb

   => No tasks!! Add tasks in the command line!
   ```  

1. ### **Display the feedback from the level of your achievement**  
   The Feedback depends on how many tasks have been completed. Gets the number of finished tasks, and if the user finished all the tasks, the feedback says, `completed all the tasks!` but if the user still has unfinished tasks, then display the number of finished and unfinished tasks as the feedback.   

   For example, when the number of tasks is 3...  
   - When the number of finished tasks is also 3, the feedback will be displayed as below.  
   ```
   Feedback: Completed all the tasks!
   ```
   - When the number of finished tasks is 2, the feedback will be displayed as below.
   ```
   Feedback: You completed 2 tasks, and have 1 more tasks!
   ```
   - If the user type the number is invalid or not number, it will be displayed as below.
   ```
   Please enter the right number
   ```  

1. ### **Save the todo list into the text file**  
   The date and tasks on the todo list are automatically saved in a text file called todo.txt.    
    
  
1. ### **Display the previous todo lists from the text file**  
   From the main menu screen, select "View previous list" to display all previous todo lists with their dates.  
  

1. ### **Delete all the todo list in the text file**  
    From the main menu screen, select "Delete previous list" to detele all the previous todo lists.
